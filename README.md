# REACH-Extensions

## HDMI to CSI adapter
The HDMI to CSI adapter allows for connecting standard Raspberry PI cameras over a standard HDMI cable (up to 10m) to the REACH unit.

## Expansion Cards
The REACH expansion cards, small PCBS, can add features such as CAN or RS232 to the REACH unit. Each card needs to have the same form factor, outline found in Expansion_Slot_Modules, as well as the standard connector footprint. The expansion card can then be connected to a standard industrial M12 connector located on the front panel of the REACH unit.
